# PersonalPortfolioSite
Hello, my name is Andrew Stokes

This is my first site as part of Project01 Capstone.

Here is the line I wrote for my first commit via Visual Studio Code.

I chose to create a personal portfolio site because I want something that will dynamically display exactly what I have done as a computer programmer.  I've used a combination of Bootstraps tabs components as well as basic html, css, and javascript, to provide you with a number of features.

    In the first tab (Who I Am) you will find a page that automatically scrolls down, and walks you through the sections of my biography.  You can stop auto scrolling by pressing spacebar at anytime.  At the end of the page you will find my LinkedIn Badge, which I added courtesy of LinkedIn's scripts.

    In the second tab (Features I've Made) you will be able to view iframes of each feature I added to the site, but in a more simplified version so as to focus in on exactly what the feature is and does.

    In the third tab (Message Me) you'll have a chance to send me feedback via a contact form.  I used formspree.io to collect the data and send it directly to my email.

Ideas for future improvement:

    A way to track and report bugs

    A maximize feature for the "Features I've Made" tab that would allow viewers to select which feature they'd like to maximize without actually leaving the site.

    An actual domain so the website can actually be hosted on a server

    Along those same lines, once it is actually on a server, LinkedIn has a feature that allows you to display a featured portion of a website on your profile.  To use this, the site would need to be styled so that it looks great on the miniature window.

Instructions to install and run:

    1. Download ZIP file

    2. Unzip file into a folder on your computer

    3. Open index.html in your browser (it should be at the bottom)

    4. Explore!

    5. Leave me any feedback you like in the Message Me tab
